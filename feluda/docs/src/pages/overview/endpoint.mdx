# Endpoint

Endpoint refers to any functionality you want to expose via a REST API. Every endpoint needs to define a Controller, Handler and Model.

## Interface Definitions

<ClassDiagram
  name="Controller"
  methods={[{ name: "get_routes" }, { name: "get_handler" }]}
/>

<ClassDiagram
  name="Handler"
  methods={[
    {
      name: "make_handlers",
      description: "map a API request path to a function",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Model:

Dataclasses that model API requests and document them. The purpose models serve is document API paramters and provide code completion.
