User Code is where you define application specific code that uses the primitives exposed by Feluda. The role of different modules is as follows

1. Endpoint : All exposed features of the search server are to be defined here. This is where you define the API routes and their handlers. [Learn more](/endpoint)
2. app.py : This is where you initialize Feluda and the endpoints and link them. [Learn more](/app-py)
3. config.yml : This is the configuration file that sets up Feluda with the appropriate parameters. [Learn More](/recipes)

Feluda Code is where the framework related code is defined. The role of different modules is as follows:

1. Server : A standard flask server that is used to expose a REST API for the search engine.
2. Config : Module that loads configuration from a provided .yml file and makes it accessible as a python dataclass for Feluda.
3. Operators : These are modules that operate on media items that your search engine works with - text, image, video, audio etc. These act as plugin code that are only loaded if specified in the config.yml file.
4. Store : Storage related modules.
5. Queue : Since some index operations can take a lot of time, they aren't well suited for the request-response formate of HTTP calls. In which case Feluda allows you to enqueue requests that get processed at a later time.
