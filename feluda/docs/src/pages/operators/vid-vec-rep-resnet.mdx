- Currently support 20 mb as the file size limit. This limit is actually on the compressed video file
  and not the original video file.
  We use FFmpeg to compress the file using the following command `ffmpeg -y -i sample_data/cat_vid_94mb.mp4 -vcodec libx265 -crf`

# Possible Optimizations :

- A lot of the intermediate steps seem to read video file from disk. Could it be held in memory and passed along those functions?
