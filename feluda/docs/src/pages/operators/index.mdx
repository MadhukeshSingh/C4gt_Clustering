# Operators

Operators lie at the heart of Tattle Search. Operators define ways in which you can manipulate data
that your search engine wants to operate on. You can configure Tattle Search to load as many or as
few operators at runtime. Your modules can then access the configured operators by its key and use it by
invoking its run method.

### Examples :

```python
text_vec = operators["text_vec_rep_paraphrase_lxml"].run(text)
image_vec = operators["image_vec_rep_resnet"].run(image)
```

To create your own operators, make a class with the interface :

<ClassDiagram
  name="Operator"
  methods={[
    { name: "initialize(param)" },
    { name: "run(data)" },
    { name: "cleanup" },
    { name: "get_state" },
  ]}
/>

Use one of the existing operators as guide. `detect_text_in_image` is a fairly simple one.

If you wish to add your operator to Tattle Search, please make a PR with your operator and test for it. In the
future we may consider a plugin architecture to allow Tattle Search to enable third party operators.

It is essential to include working tests in your operator code. Please ensure your test demonstrates all ways in which
the operator can be used. This serves as documentation for anyone who wishes to use it in their code.
